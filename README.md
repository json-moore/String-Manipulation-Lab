## String-Manipulation-Lab
This project is an open ended lab that was assigned to me in my programming college course. The language used for this project is C++. I have gotten approval to add this project to my GitHub.


#Installation
If you would like to test the program, you can download the executable [Here!](./mooreLab9Demo/x64/Debug/mooreLab9Demo.exe)
Or, navigate to releases > String Manipulation Program > Click the .exe file directly to download.

#How to use
When you run the program, you will be prompted for your personal information such as your name, phone number, and ssn (Do not enter a real SSN).
Once you enter the data as prompted, the program will display what you have entered, but in an altered format to demonstrate string manipulation.

#Purpose
This lab was an execise of many, that allowed me to practice what I have learned about strings and how data is stored in C++.
